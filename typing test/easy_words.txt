
Chuck
Houston
was
the
kind
of
man
who
wore
his
medals
on
the
inside
as
well
as
the
outside
.
Chuck
was
shot
178
times
in
the
movies
.
But
it
was
in
World
War
II
that
Chuck
became
a
real
hero
.
He
was
a
real
star
.
He
was
wounded
when
,
without
regard
for
personal
safety
,
he
heroically
thrust
himself
between
an
exploding
grenade
and
his
platoon
,
and
,
uh
...
saved
most
of
their
lives
.
This
was
in
the
South
Pacific
,
earning
him
the
Purple
Heart
.
-
You
're
93
seconds
too
long
.
-
Oh
,
damn
!
-
We
'll
fix
it
.
-
You
run
a
tight
funeral
.
Well
,
the
service
ends
at
12:15
,
we
close
casket
,
and
if
you
can
cut
93
seconds
from
your
tribute
,
we
'll
be
home
free
.
I
'll
work
on
it
.
Tomorrow
is
another
day
.

You

unlocked
.
Unlike
you
.
I
thought
you
'd
gone
.
I
checked
the
parking
lot
.
Your
car
was
n't
there
.
No
.
Well
,
it
's
in
for
service
.
I
had
a
taxi
drop
me
today
.
Maybe
you
can
take
me
home
when
this
is
over
,
just
like
old
times
.
Nice
joke
,
darling
,
but
I
only
have
a
minute
.
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
a
story
I
'm
working
on
for
Sunday
night
's
broadcast
.
It
's
about
a
once-handsome
,
never-was
actor
from
England
,
did
n't
make
it
here
either
,
who
gets
a
job
in
a
Hollywood
mortuary
.
The
mortician
takes
a
liking
to
him
and
the
actor
becomes
a
mortician
himself
,
only
our
boy
undertaker
gets
greedy
.
He
realises
morticians
can
get
to
the
bodies
before
anyone
else
,
can
find
telltale
traces
of
homosexuality
,
affairs
,
drugs
.
So
he
begins
selling
his
information
to
a
television
reporter
,
who
also
becomes
his
oh-so-secret
lover
,
until
he
unceremoniously
dumps
her
.
-
That
's
old
news
.
-
Oh
,
this
is
even
older
.
-
I
shot
this
just
a
few
days
ago
.
-
It
's
the
Dorothea
Page
mansion
.
I
knew
you
'd
recognise
it
.
Just
as
I
know
you
'll
remember
what
was
around
Dorothea
's
neck
when
her
body
arrived
here
some
years
ago
.
Eric
,
what
ratings
do
you
think
I
'll
get
for
a
story
about
a
Hollywood
mortician
who
steals
a
diamond
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
@
into
a
fancy
mortuary
?
-
Sounds
fascinating
.
-
Does
n't
it
?
I
'm
hot
on
your
trail
and
getting
warmer
by
the
minute
.
I
know
your
games
.
You
're
telling
me
this
so
that
I
'll
dig
up
dirt
for
you
again
.
Darling
,
no
!
You
're
not
listening
.
This
is
n't
blackmail
.
I
'm
broadcasting
this
Sunday
night
at
eight
,
live
.
I
'm
even
having
a
party
at
my
house
to
celebrate
.
This
is
my
big
surprise
scoop
of
the
year
.
Have
n't
told
a
soul
.

you

be
the
first
to

everything

bedroom
pet
.
I
only
came
by
to
make
sure
you
tune
in
Sunday
night
,
but
it
was
worth
it
just
to
see
that
knot
in
your
gut
.
Imagine
this
projected
behind
